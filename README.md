## Using Mocha

Mocha provides syntax & structure for building your own test suites, but relies on other libraries for its assertion testing (when working in Node it will use the Assert module by default). I personally prefer to use Chai.js, and so that's what these examples are written with, but you may substitute any other assertion library that throws an Error on its fail case.
